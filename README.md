# Companion code for "Taylor Rules and inflation anchoring
### _by Emanuele Franceschi - Paris School of Economics and Paris 1 University_

This repository contains the R programs used in the paper *"Taylor Rules and inflation anchoring"* in its latest iteration. The `MAIN.R` file gathers all steps together from library installation to results plotting. Data are fetched from online sources upon execution of the script, hence results may differ as more observations are added to the database. Data collection programs are available in a separate and independent [repository](https://www.github.com/ceschi/us_macro_data "US data collection"): it outputs an up-to-date database in csv format that can be used with all other softwares.

As of fall 2019 the programs are rather stable, but might undergo revisions according to the publication requirements of the reference paper, which has been submitted in June 2019.
