# Improvements on existing code

## Strictly necessary improvements

Following discussion with JBC:
+ sum over lags' coefficients to obtain more reliable measure of persistence
+ Devise a programmatically efficient way to estimate TRs via GMM -- to do so the package gmm accepts as input a formula, but require attaching of the database that is used, which is a bit more than painful
+ detach and extend the intro so as to have a second, smaller paper
+ correlation tables for inflations and other variables
+ reformat subsamples from 1980Q1 to 182Q2


## Easy ones: add more graphs

This is done in the `visuals.R` file: I shall add

+ ~~a Phillips Curve plot connecting dots according to dates~~
+ ~~a kernel density plot for inflations distributions~~
+ growth rates for monetary aggregates to make better sense

Synchronising effectively `USdatacoll.R` across projects (this one and `us_macro_data`) should be done seamlessly, they simply share the same file that can be plugged in.

## Time consuming, worth doing before going public

Some boring stuff, like polishing loops and vectorising, using functions calls rather big chuncks of repeated code. This actually concerns three files:

  * `inflanalysis.R`
  * `USreg.R`
  * `sim_pi.R`


## Final touch

According to Canova 2007, persistence might be estimated in the frequency spectrum as the spike on the lowest frequency. I do already have some functions set up for spectral analysis, recover and adapt should be feasible.
